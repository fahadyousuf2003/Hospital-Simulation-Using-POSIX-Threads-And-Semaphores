# Hospital Simulation Code 

This readme provides an overview of the hospital simulation code, which is written in C and designed for a Linux kernel module. The code simulates the operation of a hospital with doctors and patients using kernel threads. It is important to note that this code is designed for educational purposes and does not represent a real-world hospital system.

## 1. Introduction

The hospital simulation code simulates the interaction between doctors and patients in a hospital setting using Linux kernel threads. It demonstrates how multiple threads can be synchronized using spinlocks to model a simple healthcare system.

## 2. Code Overview

The code consists of the following components:

- `DEFINE_SPINLOCK`: Macros to define spinlocks for doctor, patient, and mutex synchronization.

- Global variables to track the number of doctors, patients, and waiting patients.

- Structures to store information about doctors and patients.

- Functions for doctor and patient behavior, including treatment, waiting, and changing status.

- A system call named `sys_hospital` that creates and manages doctor and patient threads.

## 3. Structures

- `struct doctor_info`: Stores information about a doctor, including their ID and status.

- `struct patient_info`: Stores information about a patient, including their ID and status.

## 4. Thread Functions

### `int doctor(void* data)`

- Represents the behavior of a doctor thread.
- Registers doctors and treats patients.
- Doctors either treat patients or rest when there are no patients to treat.

### `int patient(void* data)`

- Represents the behavior of a patient thread.
- Patients wait for available doctors, change status during their hospital visit, and eventually leave the hospital.

## 5. System Call

### `asmlinkage long sys_hospital(void)`

- The system call that creates and manages doctor and patient threads.
- Initializes and starts the threads and waits for them to complete.
- Returns 0 upon completion.

## 6. Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a Linux environment with kernel headers installed.

2. Compile the code and install the kernel module.

   ```shell
   make
   sudo insmod hospital_module.ko
   ```

3. Execute the `sys_hospital` system call to start the hospital simulation.

   ```shell
   sudo ./hospital_simulation
   ```

4. Observe the simulation's output in the kernel log.

5. Remove the kernel module when you are done.

   ```shell
   sudo rmmod hospital_module
   ```
